BreadMan
========

A simple game played with a frozen loaf of bread, a warm body, and a 
thermister. 

An 8x8 LED matrix displays your current position on the left
side of the screen, and obstacles fall from the right side of the screen.
Your position is determined by the termperature of the thermister - hotter
is up, colder is down. For each obstacle (or pair of obstacles, in hard 
mode) that the player avoids, the player gets a point. The player has three
lives, which they lose by hitting obstacles. When all three lives are lost,
the game is over and the score is displayed.

There is also a musical accompaniment, including a title theme (the intro to
the first gen Pokemon wild battle music), a main theme (the body of said wild
battle music), and various sound effects.
